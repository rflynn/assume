Goals

  * Define formal method-style framework for high-level
    programming languages (HLL).
  * Define popular HLL in terms of this framework.
  * Parse programs written in HLLs and validate against
    language definition.
  * Detect defective constructs.
  * Ultimate analyze and improve large codebases written
    in the C programming language.
