                                -- Edsger W. Dijkstra

assume is to lint as a whitelist is to a blacklist.

Goals

  * Define formal method-style framework for high-level programming languages (HLL).
  * Define popular HLL in terms of this framework.
  * Build HLL lexers/parsers.
  * Parse programs written in HLLs and validate against language definition.
  * Detect ambiguous, non-canonical, defect-containing constructs.
  * Optionally transform source code.
  * Ultimate goal is to be able to detect potential defects in large codebases
    written in the C programming language.
