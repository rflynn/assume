<h1>Object Axioms</h1>

<p>
this is a psuedocode-style attempt at the definition of a set of axiomatic
rules for the description of <a href="programming-language-model.html#object">software objects</a>.

<h2>FOUNDATIONAL</h2>

TODO: we need proper references to set theory, math, etc.

<dl>
  <dt>that which can not be found does not exist. (exist.unfound)</dt>
  <dd>
  an object, once declared, if not later retrievable is equivalent to a non-existing object.
  </dd>

  <dt>that which cannot be used does not exist. (exist.unused)</dt>
  <dd>
  a declared object, if never potentially used is equivalent to a non-existing object.
  </dd>

  <dt>A.B /= B.A (order.matters)</dt>
  <dd>
  it is implicitly assumed that the operation of arbitrary software objects is
  non-commutative; therefore it is assumed that the order in which software objects
  are invoked affects the result.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>OBJECT DEFINITION</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>let an <em>object</em> be a non-empty, finite <em>set</em> of objects sharing some relation. (obj.def)</dt>
  <dd>
    <ol>
      <li>let an object's cardinality |obj| be &gt;= 1 and &lt; &#8734;
      <li>let an element of an object be a <em>member</em>.
          <div class="symbolic">&exist;(x,obj){x &isin; obj}</div>
      <li>let the relationship of object to member be <em>parent</em>.<br>
      <li>let the relationship of a member to its parent be <em>child</em>.
      <li>let the relationship between two children of the same parent be <em>sibling</em>.<br>
          <div class="symbolic">&exist;(obj,x,y){x &isin; obj &and; y &isin; obj}</div>
      <li>for each member in an object let there be a relationship, in either direction between it and one or more siblings.
          <div class="symbolic">&exist;(obj,x,y){(x &isin; obj &and; y &isin; obj) &and; (x &rarr; y &or; y &rarr; x)}</div>
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt>let an object have the property <em>primitive</em> (ob.def.prim)</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>let the primitive property be a boolean, being one of {<em>true</em>,<em>false</em>}
      <li>a primitive object must contain, at minimum, a <em>bitvector</em> of known, fixed size
      <li>a non-primitive object contains at least one primitive object or another non-primitive object.
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>let an object have the property <em>type</em> (obj.def.type)</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li class="error">
      let objects of the same type contain the same number of members of the same types (bijection).
      <p>
      Counter-example: metaprogramming(?)
      <li>conversely, objects that are bijective are not necessarily the same type.
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>let the set of values of an object's members be known as <em>state</em> (obj.def.state)</dt>
  <dd></dd>

</dl>

<h2>MEMBERS</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>let a property of object membership be called <em>exposure</em> (obj.mem.expose)</dt>
  <dd>
  <ul>
    <li>let the exposure of an object member be one of {<em>exposed</em>,<em>hidden</em>}.
  </ul>
  NOTE: exposure is a property of the membership relation, not of the member object itself.
  </dd>

  <dt>let the exposure of all object members to other members of the same object be exposed (obj.mem.expose.intra)</dt>
  <dd>
    i.e. members of the same object can all see each other.
  </dd>

  <dt>an object must contain at least one member which is exposed (obj.mem.expose.extra)</dt>
  <dd>
    if there was no way for an external object to access an object, it would be equivalent to non-existant.
    <p>
    References:
    <ol>
      <li>exist.unfound
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt>an object may contain one or more member which is externally hidden (obj.mem.expose.hidden)</dt>
  <dd>
    References:
    <ol>
      <li>obj.def
      <li>obj.mem.expose.min
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt><strike>let child member exposure to objects outside its parent be uniform (obj.mem.expose.extra.uniform)</strike></dt>
  <dd>
  <strike>
  <ul>
    <li>let an exposed member be a child about which its parent makes accessible to another, extra-parent object.
    <li>let a hidden member be a child about which 
    <li>member exposure is defined once per member for all extra-parent objects, not on a per extra-parent-object basis.Q
  </ul>
  </strike>
  <div class="error">Counter-example: C++ <code>friend</code></div>
  </dd>

  <dt>infer: an object has incomplete knowledge of the contents of other objects. (obj.mem.info.extra)</dt>
  <dd>
  an object may not know about all members of another object which exist.
  furthermore, it may not know what it does not know.
  an object's knowledge about other objects is incomplete.
  <p>
    References:
    <ol>
      <li>obj.mem.expose.hidden
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt>the order in in which object's exposed members are accessed by external objects is indeterminate. (obj.mem.ctrl.extra.indeterminate)</dt>
  <dd>
    References:
    <ol>
      <li>obj.mem.expose.min
      <li>obj.mem.ctrl.extra
    </ol>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2>SIBLING RELATIONSHIP</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>every object member has as its input a non-empty subset of its siblings (obj.mem.input)</dt>
  <dd>
    <ol>
      <li>acess of a primitive object is equivalent to the identity function.
        <div class="symbolic">obj = id(obj)</div>
      <li>a non-primitive object has itself and zero or more siblings as its input and output
    </ol>
    References:
    <ol>
      <li>obj.def
      <li>obj.mem.expose.intra
    </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt>infer: an object member that does not reference a member of its parent object is not a
      member of the object (obj.mem.exclude)</dt>
  <dd>
  an object that does not depend on any input or does not affect the output
  of any other member of its parent is equivalent to the same member being
  outside of that object.
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2>STATE</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>a change in state of any member constitutes a change in the parent state (obj.state.change)</dt>
  <dd>
  References:
  <ol>
    <li>obj.def.state
  </ol>
  </dd>

  <dt>infer: an object's state as the output from an exposed member may be fed to the input of any other exposed member. (obj.mem.state.io)</dt>
  <dd>
  because exposed members can be called in any order, the resulting object
  state output from any exposed member may be used as the input to any
  other exposed member.
  </dd>

  <dt>object state as defined by any exposed member output must be valid input to all other exposed members (obj.mem.state.valid)</dt>
  <dd>

  Because order matters, because we can't control the actions of external objects, because an external access may change our object state and because our members take a subset of object state as their input...

  References:
  <ol>
    <li>order.matters
    <li>obj.mem.ctrl.extra
    <li>obj.mem.input
    <li>obj.mem.state.io
  </ol>

  <p>
  Example:
<pre>
    Obj o:
      foo = "x"          # assign, yield "x"
      bar(): foo = NULL
      baz(): foo[0]      #undefined for NULL
    
    assuming foo,bar,baz are all exposed, check combinations:
    foo,bar -&gt; defined
    foo,baz -&gt; defined
    bar,foo -&gt; defined
    bar,baz -&gt; undefined # this order results in an undefined operation
    baz,bar -&gt; defined
    baz,foo -&gt; defined
</pre>
    NOTE: this is an exceedingly simplistic example, and real-world code
    will likely be significantly more complicated and who's behavior depends
    on the value of inputs as well as the order of invocation.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>EQUALITY</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>objects containing indentical states can be considered equivalent (obj.state.equivalent)</dt>
  <dd>
  QUESTION: how do they inspect hidden members? objects may contain hidden
            members that are inaccessible to other objects. how do we resolve
            this?
            do we define an "impartial observer" that is allowed access to all
            object members? is omniscience implicit?
            if so, then true equality cannot be implemented by an object itself,
            but only by an outsider.
            but the term "equality" is an overloaded one... let us instead define
            "identiciality"
