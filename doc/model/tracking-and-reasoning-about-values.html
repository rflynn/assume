<h1>Tracking and Reasoning About Values</h1>

<p>
let us explore how to reason about values as we track them through the flow of a program.

<p>
let us see what patterns we see

<p>
from each possible source, and then total...
<ul>
  <li>min possible
  <li>max possible
  <li>eval expr
</ul>

<pre>

0|  unsigned foo(unsigned i) {
1|    if (i % 2)
2|      i -= 6;
3|    return i;
4|  }

because foo() is a function what we know about i depends.
if foo() is static then
  we can know exactly who is calling it, its <em>dominators</em>.
else if foo() is not static but part of a standalone application with main()
  we can know who is calling it by using whole program analysis to find out
  which other objects in the program call foo()
else if foo() is part of a library with no well-defined entrypoint
  we can know only partially who calls it by using whole program analysis

figure out range

we should naively assume that it could be any possible unsigned value
[UINT_MIN=0, UINT_MAX=0xfffffff]

we should then, for each possible invocation of foo() from other places
in the program, try to ascertain the range of potential values.

really, what we should do is track that range at every step of the entire
program; then that information would be available.

so, assuming we don't know anything about who is calling foo(), let's
see what we can see.

we'll keep track of {[min,max],overflow?,overflow?,potential_error?}

typedef uint8_t u8;

0|  u8 foo(u8 i) {  /* i={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} */
1|    if (i % 2)    /* i={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} */
2|      i -= 6;     /* i={[0,0xFF],1,0,0} */
3|    return i;     /* i={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} */
4|  }

so without any contextual clues we know that the function reduces the
possible range of the input only slightly, and that given input in
in the range [0,6) it will underflow.

so let's say we notify the programmer of the potential underflow
and he fixes it:

0|  u8 foo(u8 i) {        /* i={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} */
1|    if (i &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; i % 2) /* i={[7,0xFF],0,0,0} (6 doesn't pass % 2) */
2|      i -= 6;           /* i={[1,0xFF],0,0,0} */
3|    return i;           /* i={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} */
4|  }

now we know for certain that foo() cannot underflow.
but that's an easy example, let's try a harder one.

0|  u8 foo2(u8 i, u8 j) { /* i={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} j={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} */
1|    if (i &gt; 5 &amp;&amp; i % j) /* i={[6,0xFF],0,0,0} j={[0,0xFF],0,0,1} */
2|      i -= 6;           /* i={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} j={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} */
3|    return i;           /* i={[1,0xFF],0,0,0} j={[0,0xFF],0,0,0} */
4|  }

since we don't know the value of either i or j there isn't much we can tell,
but we can detect that, because j can be 0 on line 2 that using it as the
right-hand operand to % will result in undefined behavior.

now let's see what we can figure out if we track a variable through
multiple functions

0|  u8 bar(void) {
1|    u8 i, sum = 0;
2|    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
3|      sum += foo(i); /* i={[0,9],0,0,0} sum={[0,0xFF,0,0,0} */
4|    return sum; }
5|  u8 foo(u8 i) {  /* i={[0,9],0,0,0} */
6|    if (i % 2)    /* i={[0,9],0,0,0} */
7|      i -= 6;     /* i={[0,9],1,0,0} */
8|    return i; }   /* i={[0,9],0,0,0} */

</pre>

<hr>

more generally, in order to analyze programs at a higher level perhaps we could
classify functions like circuits:

<h3>Muxer</h3>
function reduces complexity of input
<p>
<ul>
  <li>size_t strlen(const char *) - reduces strings to a single unsigned integer
  <li>int isalpha(int) - reduces integer value to [0,1]
</ul>

<h3>Demuxer</h3>
function increases complexity of input
<ul>
  <li>void *malloc(size_t bytes); /* turns unsigned int into unspecified void* */
  <li>FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char *mode); /* turns 2 strings into a FILE * */
</ul>

<h3>Passthrough</h3>
function does not increase or decrease the complexity of input
<ul>
  <li>int rand(void) - turns static seed integer into a new seed integer and copies it
  <li>identity function x = id(x)
  <li>(+1)
  <li>get_next_foo()
</ul>

also, i think it would be helpful to identify
